description: The three population out-of-African model popularized by Gutenkunst et
  al. (2009) and augmented by archaic contributions to both Eurasian and African populations.
  Two archaic populations split early in human history, before the African expansion,
  and contribute to Eurasian populations (putative Neanderthal branch) and to the
  African branch (a deep diverging branch within Africa). Admixture is modeled as
  symmetric migration between the archaic and modern human branches, with contribution
  ending at a given time in the past.
