# Previous Final Projects

Here you will find examples of final projects completed by previous BIOL1435 students.



## Overview

### `genealogical_linkage_2k23.pdf`

This final project utilized simulations in `msprime` to better understand the relationship between genealogical linkage and linkage disequilibrium that was originally described in [McKenzie and Eaton 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.02.233395).

### `high_altitude_adaptive_introgression_2k23.pdf`

This final project applied the methods from the course to investigate their lab's dataset for signatures of adaptive introgression.

### `human_chimp_gorilla_divergence_2k23.pdf`

This final project utilized publicly available genome assemblies to re-asses the claims of X chromosome divergence from [Patterson et al. 2006](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04789) and to investigate patterns of Y chromosome divergence among humans, chimps, and gorillas.

### `introgressed_tract_hmm_2k23.pdf`

This final project used site patterns to create a HMM for inferring introgressed tracts in simulated data using `msprime`.

### `mimulus_pop_gen_2k23.pdf`

This final project applied methods from the course to reproduce some of the results from [Brandvain et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004410).

### `tp53_pop_gen_2k23.pdf`

This final project applied the methods from the course to investigate the patterns of diversity and divergence at the tumor suppressor gene _TP53_ using individuals from 1000 Genomes Project.
