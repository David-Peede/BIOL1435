# Lectures

This directory contains all the files necessary to recreate my lectures from scratch!



## `data`

Any and all data I used to generate figures for lectures and to run analyses for in class exercises.

## `exercise_notebooks`

Jupyter Notebooks for students to work through to reinforce concepts from lecture.

## `figure_notebooks`

Jupyter Notebooks to create figures for lecture and for students to reference as plotting examples. __NOTE:__ Until I teach this course again—and come up with a better file management system—these Jupyter Notebooks are named according to my spring 2k23 file management system.

## `figures`

Outputs from the Jupyter Notebooks found in the `figure_notebooks` directory along with diagrams and screenshots that were used in my lectures. __NOTE:__ Until I teach this course again—and come up with a better file management system—these figures are named according to my spring 2k23 file management system.

## `recordings`

Lecture recordings in `mp4` format.

## `slides`

Lecture slides in `pdf` format.
