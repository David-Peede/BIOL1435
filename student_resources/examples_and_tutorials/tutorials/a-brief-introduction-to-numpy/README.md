# A Brief Introduction To `NumPy`

I am continually updating the `a_brief_introduction_to_numpy.ipynb` notebook and hope to add a `numpy_puzzles.ipynb` notebook in the near future! I would greatly appreciate any and all feedback as well as puzzles encountered in daily life for the development of the `numpy_puzzles.ipynb` notebook!
